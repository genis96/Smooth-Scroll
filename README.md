# Smooth-Scroll
Smooth-Scrolling on this Website using HTML and CSS
You can also use jquery or Javascript to activate the smooth scroll. But here, I used CSS.

Using:
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
    overflow-y: scroll;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    scroll-snap-align: center

and keeping the Navbar fixed to the top so when a user clicks on the navbar links, it will directly pull you down to the content desired.
